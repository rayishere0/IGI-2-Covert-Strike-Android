# I.G.I. 2: Covert Strike (Native Android Engine)

A ground-up, high-performance native Android port of the classic tactical stealth first-person shooter **I.G.I. 2: Covert Strike** (2003).

This project runs the game natively on Android ARM64 devices (`com.projectigi2.app`) without emulation or compatibility layers, combining an embedded **.NET 10.0 CoreCLR** runtime, **Vulkan 1.1** graphics, and **OpenAL Soft** spatial audio with authentic retail game logic, assets, and QVM menu system.

## User Instructions (How to Play)

For copyright compliance, this APK contains **no copyrighted game data**. To play the game:

1. **Install the APK** on your Android device (ARM64 device running Android 7.0+).
2. **Copy your PC Game Folder** to your Android device storage (e.g., in `/sdcard/Download/IGI 2`). Your game directory must be the installation's **`pc` folder** — the one that contains `igi2.exe` alongside the original PC game folders (`common/`, `missions/`, `menusystem/`, `language/`, `config.qvm`).
3. **Launch I.G.I. 2** on your device.
4. On the launcher splash screen, tap **`SELECT GAME FOLDER`**.
5. Select your copied `pc` folder using Android's system file picker.
6. The app will automatically verify the game file structure and enable the **`PLAY`** button.
7. Tap **`PLAY`** to launch into the game!

```

1. **Android Shell (`app/android`)**:
   - `MainActivity.java` creates an immersive fullscreen `SurfaceView` and hands its `ANativeWindow` handle down to native C++ via JNI.
   - Includes a standalone SAF game folder selector and verifier to load external authentic game files. It verifies the I.G.I. 2 installation (signature file `igi2.exe`, data root is the `pc` folder).

2. **Native Layer (`app/android/app/src/main/cpp`)**:
   - `jni_bridge.cpp` boots the embedded .NET CoreCLR host, passes display parameters, and registers low-latency touch and keyboard callbacks.
   - Compiled with symbol obfuscation (`-fvisibility=hidden -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL`) to strip internal NDK function signatures.
   - Integrates **OpenAL Soft 1.23.1** compiled natively for Android ARM64 with the `OpenSL ES` backend for low-latency 3D positional audio.

3. **Engine Core (`src/`)**:
   - **`ProjectIGI.Rendering.Vulkan`**: Low-overhead Vulkan 1.1 renderer utilizing ANativeWindow surfaceKHR, optimized forward rendering, baked lightmaps, and high-performance 2D sprite batching.
   - **`ProjectIGI.Game.Igi2`**: Re-implementation of I.G.I. 2 game logic — guard AI perception/patrol paths, squads, alarms, weapon ballistics, bullet penetration, inventory, and health mechanics.
   - **`ProjectIGI.Presentation.Igi2`**: Executes original `mainmenu.qvm` bytecode directly, reproducing the authentic retail menu, mission selector, and debriefing screens.
   - **`ProjectIGI.Audio.OpenAL`**: Drives dynamic environmental reverb, directional footsteps, alarms, and weapon acoustics.

The Android host (`AndroidHost.cs`) runs the I.G.I. 2 title through `TitleCatalog.For(GameTitle.Igi2)`. The engine's title system is shared with the I.G.I. 1 port — the same host, renderer and input stack, pointed at a different game.

## Original mission terrain prototype

The first step toward an original mountain, compound and lakeside mission is a deterministic terrain authoring prototype. With the .NET 10 SDK, run:

```bash
dotnet run --project apps/ProjectIGI.TerrainPrototype -- /path/to/new-output-directory
dotnet run --project apps/ProjectIGI.TerrainPrototype -- --self-test
```

The output directory must not already exist. The tool creates `heightmaps.res`, containing a 256 x 256 I.G.I. 2 height tile, and a grayscale `terrain-preview.pgm` image. The intended tile span is 1,200 x 1,200 metres: the northwest plateau is the lookout, the central-eastern plateau is reserved for the compound, and the southeast basin is reserved for the lake. Heights are encoded in engine units (4,096 units per metre).

**This is not a playable level and should not be copied over retail files.** The archive still needs a custom mission definition and `TerrainMap` placement, materials, water, buildings, vegetation, navigation, objectives and a safe Android delivery/loading path. The preview shows height only, not water or finished scenery. The generated archive is checked with the existing readers, but it has not yet been loaded in the game.

## Key Features & Current Build Highlights

- **Decoupled Game Files**: 100% clean repository and APK with no bundled copyrighted game data.
- **Optimized 30 FPS Target Pacing**: Frame loop pacer strictly enforces a **30 FPS** target frame limit by default for smooth battery-friendly mobile gameplay.
- **Authentic Retail Experience**: All 19 campaign missions, cutscenes, briefing audio, textures, weapon models, sound effects, and retail menu screens.
- **Responsive Touch HUD & Controls**:
  - Full multi-touch overlay with dual-stick movement, aiming, crouch, jump, reload, scope, and weapon selection.
  - **I.G.I. 2 stance buttons**: step the stance up (prone to crouch, crouch to stand) and down (stand to crouch, crouch to prone); prone is reached by tapping stance-down. Buttons can be dragged to reposition in the HUD customizer.
  - Interactive **Pause Button (`||`)** that instantly halts game simulation, AI, and level updates.
- **Clean Cutscene Audio & Skip Rules**:
  - Mission background music automatically pauses during cutscenes for crisp dialogue playback.
  - Interactive hold-to-skip ring for mid-mission cutscenes; post-mission completion cutscenes run unprompted for clean cinematic transitions.
- **Subtle Cheats Gear Icon**: A compact, unobtrusive gear icon on the main menu opens an on-demand modal overlay for:
  - **Infinite Health** (zero damage from bullets, falls, explosions, electric fences)
  - **Infinite Ammunition** (reserves never deplete)
  - **All Weapons** (unlocks full arsenal for the mission)

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

### One-command build (Linux/macOS)

From the repository root, run:

```bash
./build_android.sh
```

The script publishes and deploys the managed ARM64 assemblies, builds and verifies the release APK, and saves the full diagnostic log under `app/android/build/logs/`.

### 1. Build and Publish .NET ARM64 Assemblies

From the root of the repository:

```bash
dotnet publish apps/ProjectIGI.Android/ProjectIGI.Android.csproj -c Release -r android-arm64 --no-self-contained
```

Copy the compiled managed `.dll` and `.pdb` files into the Android project's asset directory. Use the deploy script — it does this for you (and the Android Studio build alone does **not** refresh the managed DLLs, so a stale build is the first thing to check when a fix seems missing):

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\deploy_managed_assets.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./deploy_managed_assets.sh
```

### 2. Build the Android Release APK

Navigate to the `app/android` directory and run Gradle:

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd app\android
gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
cd app/android
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The generated APK will be located at:
`app/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
